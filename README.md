# Closest Waypoints To Address

This is another weekend project to create a neat tool for real estate investing. This project takes an address and can return the closest waypoints (restaurants, schools, transit, etc.) and the waypoint's distance/drive time.

This tool will serve to help myself and other real estate investors be able to quickly assess and quantify the "livability" aspects of a home.
